cucumber_arrioo
===============


What?
====

Cucumber Pretty Formatter that outputs  
  - only Scenarios,Feature file names and failing steps
  - flashes out currently running step in the console

Tested with Cucumber 0.10.5


Why?
====
As I felt pretty format is too verbose ;) , Lookng at [SlowHandCuke] (https://github.com/moredip/SlowHandCuke) sparked this idea



How To Install
==============

Just copy <code>arrioo_formatter</code> to <code>features/support</code>

Then add <code> -f arrioo </code>to your cucumber command-line.
