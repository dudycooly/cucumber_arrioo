cucumber_arrioo
===============


What?
====

Cucumber Pretty Formatter that outputs  only Scenarios,Feature file names and failing steps

Tested with Cucumber 0.10.5


Why?
====
As I felt pretty format is too verbose ;) , Lookng at [SlowHandCuke] (https://github.com/moredip/SlowHandCuke) sparked this idea



How To Install
==============

Just copy arrioo_formatter to features/support/
Then <code> add -f arrioo </code>to your cucumber command-line.
